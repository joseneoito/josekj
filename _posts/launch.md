Congragulations that you are planning to launch a new product, this article is going to give you insight on how to get your product to investors, propspetus customers.

1. Once your product is finalised, and ready for release then try to get in touch with local prod hunt group members, join their social media group ask for their feedbacks[there will be many product builders], once everything fine, decide a date to launch the product at utc time early morning so the product will be visible for more time in that day.ALso inform the product hunt group mebers about your lunch and similarly post the launch info various groups so many people can upvote ur product.
